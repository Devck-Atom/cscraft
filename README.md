# cscraft
Minecraft clone made with C#/OpenTK library. It's pretty poorly optimized, but it should work fine.

I made this game to learn OpenGL and the C# programming language, so the code it's a total mess. 
The game has the basic features of a Minecraft voxel-engine:
- Chunk mesh generation
- Infinite world
- Breaking/placing blocks

# How to run the game:
Only tested with Windows 10 x64
1. Download and install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) if you don't have it.
2. Just run **dotnet run** from the terminal inside the project folder and the game should run!
